# bedrock_dev_wish_list
some features/fixes/clarifications that would make us bedrock devs jollier 

uuids suck

a way to track game state other than variant and skins and tags

actual namespaces, see package managers like npm or pip..namespaces should be automatic based on pack name and pack name should be unique on the marketplace

game items and entities should have IDs so we don't have to refer to them by string name. Names change. ID's don't.
